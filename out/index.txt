This white paper proposes a revolutionary online donation platform designed to empower voters, bypass the uni-party structure, and provide a financial lifeline to candidates who challenge the status quo.

This structure funnels money through party organizations, which prioritize incumbents and candidates aligned with the uni-party agenda. As a result, independent or disruptive candidates struggle to secure the financial resources needed to compete, particularly against well-funded party-backed opponents. Furthermore, donors often lack direct influence over how their contributions are used, as parties allocate funds based on internal priorities rather than donor preferences.
